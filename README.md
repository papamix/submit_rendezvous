Submit - Rendezvous

This project was one of my first attempts at PHP web development for the
purposes of a course as an undergrad at the University of Crete. It implements
a web-based system for handing in exercises and booking appointments for
examination.  The appointment booking portion (Rendezvous) has been used
extensively in multiple courses at the University of Crete over the course of
the last few years. The exercise hand-in portion (Submit) was tested back when
I developed this, but it was never actually deployed due to some PHP issues
with our webserver.
